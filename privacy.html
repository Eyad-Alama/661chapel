		<h2>G. COMMUNICATION OR UTILIZATION DATA</h2>
		<p>1. Through your use of telecommunications services to access the Group’s Website, your communications data (e.g. Internet protocol address) or utilization data (e.g. information on the beginning, end and extent of each access, and information on the telecommunications services you accessed) are technically generated and could conceivably relate to Personal Information.</p>
		<p>2. To the extent that there is a compelling necessity, the collection, processing and use of your communications or utilization data will occur and will be performed in accordance with the Act.</p>

		<h2>H. NON-IDENTIFYING DATA COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY</h2>

		<p>1. When you access the Group’s Website, the Group may automatically (i.e., not by registration) collect non-identifying data (e.g. type of Internet browser and operating system used, domain name of the website from which you came, number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed).</p>

		<p>2. The Group may use this data and share it with the rest of the Group to monitor the attractiveness of the Group’s Website and to improve their performance or content.</p>

When you view the Group’s Website, the Group may store some non-identifying data on your computer in the form of a "cookie" to automatically recognize your personal computer next time you visit. We may log IP addresses (that is, the electronic addresses of computers connected to the internet) to analyse trends, administer the website, track users movements, and gather broad demographic information.</p>

		<p>2. Cookies can help the Group in many ways, for example, by allowing the Group to tailor a website to better match your interests or to store your password to save you having to re-enter it each time.</p>

		<p>3. If you do not wish to receive cookies, please configure your Internet browser to erase all cookies from your computer's hard drive, block all cookies or to receive a warning before a cookie is stored.</p>

		<p>2. The Group reserves the right to use, reproduce, disclose, transmit, publish, broadcast and/or post elsewhere such information freely as set out in (C) above.</p>

		<h2>K. SAFETY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
		<p>1. We take reasonable steps to ensure your personal information is protected from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. The Group uses a number of mechanisms to protect the security and integrity of your Personal Information.</p>

		<p>2. For the internet, unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as completely secure. So while the Group strives to protect such Personal Information, the Group cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Information transmitted to the Group and you do so at your own risk. Once any Personal Information comes into the Group’s possession, the Group will take reasonable steps to protect that information from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>

		<p>4. We may hold your information in either electronic or hard copy form. Personal information is destroyed or de-identified when no longer needed or when we are no longer required by law to retain it (whichever is the later).</p>

		<h2>L. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
		<p>1. Due to the global nature of the Group’s business, the Group may transfer your Personal Information to Group members and our related bodies corporate and third party suppliers and service providers located overseas for some of the purposes listed above. Any Personal Information transferred shall be used for the purposes as set out in (B) above and disclosed to parties stated in (C) above.</p>

		<p>1. The Group’s Website may contain links to other sites and pages.

		<p>2. We make no representations or warranties in relation to the privacy practices of any third party website and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of any third party website.

We may charge you a reasonable fee to cover our administrative and other reasonable costs in providing the information to you. We will not charge for simply making the request and will not charge for making any corrections to your Personal Information.</p>
		<p>2. There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the Personal Information that we hold about you. For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.</p>

		inaccurate, then you may request that we amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment then we will add a note to the Personal Information stating that you disagree with it.</p>
